	For this exercise we use the library of \textbf{Trixi.jl}, for the solution of DGSEM, where we use the Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre quadrature, all it's developed in the library

	As we can see in these graphics, for polynomial degree$=3$ the behavior it's almost the same, maybe there is a difference but we cannot distinguish only looking at the graph, for polynomial degree$=1$, the  central flux, is worst than the godunov flux, we discuss what could be the origin of this, but we couldn't get a satisfactory answer, It is left as an exercise for the reader.\end{document}
