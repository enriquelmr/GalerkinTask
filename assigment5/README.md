# Exercise 5.3 for "Numerical Methods for PDEs - Galerkin Methods", Summer Term 2022


You can reproduce the results by executing
```julia
include("ex5-3.jl")
visual_ex03(50,1)
```
in visual_ex03(number_elements,pol_degree), you can change the polynomial degree or the number of elements that u want and you will have the solution saved as a png file, you are free to change the parameters as you want.

The code was developed for Julia v1.7.2.
